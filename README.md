# Part 2

I couldn't decide between these two articles, so I think I should just share them both!

1. AI Trained on Old Scientific Papers Makes Discoveries Humans Missed

Basically, scientists let an AI rougue on some scientific research papers. Using only word associations, the algorithm was able to come up with ideas for future thermoelectric materials, some of them were better than those we currently use.

This was of particular interest to me, as I just finished an AI paper, and I could actually understand what they meant when they tech-talked about neural networks. Aside from this though, I think it's a super interesting read if you have an interest in AI, especially unsupervised AI. As it goes through and roughly explains how bot works.

1. Boston Dynamics' robot dog is now available for select customers

This one is sort of a resurgence of a robot from a few years ago, however the article talks about it's commericalisation. This one is a great read, purely for the youtube video of the 'dog' creepily walking through a landscape, and opening doors. I find it facisnating, as it looks like the robot dogs of black mirror. It is also mesmerising the way it moves, and the features it has are incredible. I think the idea of it being on the market, and having a programmable API is equal parts terrifying and equal parts encouraging. The article also goes into practical uses for the robot technology, i.e. miliatry usage. 

This is absolutly a great article if you have any interest in robotics, especially the cool/creepy/cute human-like robots that are becoming a reality.
